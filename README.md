# CauseForce Custom Theme

This custom wordpress theme was created for CauseForce.com.

This custom theme is built using Sage (roots.io/sage).

## How to deploy

To deploy, in the terminal or command prompt, you must change your directory to your theme's folder.

While in the theme's folder, you must first build the custom them using gulp command `gulp build`. Alternatively, you can also use `gulp build --watch` to have gulp constantly build and watch for changes.

This will create a `dist` folder. Take the `dist` folder, and drop it in the FTP to the theme's file path to add or overwrite the previous `dist` folder.
